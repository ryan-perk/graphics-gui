# graphics_gui

LineTransformin.java is a basic computer graphics GUI that can draw lines from user input 
or an input file, translate them, scale them around the origin or a specific point, and 
rotate them around the origin or a specific point. The line data can then be exported to 
a .txt file for later use.
